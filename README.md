## Linux Server Infrastructure & Hardening Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for **coderacket.com**, a portfolio site documenting my work and approach in **Linux server infrastructure auditing and hardening**.

The site is intentionally focused on:
- SSH configuration review and hardening
- NGINX configuration hardening
- Baseline Linux server security practices
- Case-study-driven documentation rather than marketing claims

It is not a showcase of frontend or application development services.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this site is to:
- Present a clear, defensible scope of infrastructure-focused work
- Document configurations, trade-offs, and operational considerations
- Serve as a reference point for SSH and NGINX hardening case studies

The content emphasizes **configuration accuracy, risk reduction, and operational safety** over feature breadth.

---

## Technical Notes

The site is built as a static, dependency-light project and prioritizes:
- Clear structure
- Accessibility fundamentals
- Minimal attack surface
- Predictable behavior across devices

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (minimal, non-framework)
- Responsive layout
- Basic accessibility best practices

---

## Site Features

- Scope definition for Linux infrastructure work
- Documented and in-progress case studies
- Contact form for scope discussions
- Links to GitHub and professional profiles

---

## Supporting Authentication Demo

A lightweight **Flask Auth MVP** is maintained in a separate repository to complement these Linux server hardening workflows. 
It demonstrates **secure authentication, session management, and TLS handling** in a containerized Flask application.

- Repo: [Flask Auth MVP](https://github.com/CodeRacket/flask_auth_mvp)
- Purpose: Educational reference for **server security interactions**, not a production-ready web service
