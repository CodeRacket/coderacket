## Linux Server Infrastructure & Hardening Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for **coderacket.com**, a portfolio site documenting my work and approach in **Linux server infrastructure auditing and hardening**.

The site is intentionally focused on:
- SSH configuration review and hardening
- NGINX configuration hardening
- Baseline Linux server security practices
- Case-study-driven documentation rather than marketing claims

It is not a showcase of frontend or application development services.

## Purpose

The goal of this site is to:
- Present a clear, defensible scope of infrastructure-focused work
- Document configurations, trade-offs, and operational considerations
- Serve as a reference point for SSH and NGINX hardening case studies

The content emphasizes **configuration accuracy, risk reduction, and operational safety** over feature breadth.

## Technical Notes

The site is built as a static, dependency-light project and prioritizes:
- Clear structure
- Accessibility fundamentals
- Minimal attack surface
- Predictable behavior across devices

### Technologies Used
